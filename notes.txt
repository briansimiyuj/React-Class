If we want to deploy our React project, we have to optimized it to a folder called build. This is done by running the following command:

    `npm run build`

To see the optimized assets locally, we need to install the Serve package with the following command:

    `npm i -g serve`

Then run the serve command:

    `serve -s build -p ${port}`
